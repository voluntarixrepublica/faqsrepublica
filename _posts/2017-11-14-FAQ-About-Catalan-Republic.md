## Current situation

### Why do catalans want independence?

The pro-independence movement has been around since 1931, but it gained momentum in the last decade. There are quite a few reasons why catalans are seeking their independence.

- The main reason is self-rule. Although some people say Catalonia enjoys a great autonomy, the truth is that for the past years a big amount of laws approved by the Catalan Parliament have been repealed. Laws favouring equality between men and women, regulating opening hours for stores, protecting those who can't afford heating during winter, a tax for long-term empty housing... all of them were repealed or overturned after they were approved. The most iconic case is bullfighting: Catalans think of animal suffering shows in general, and bullfighting in particular, as animal torture. The catalan people brought a [Popular Legislative Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative) to the Catalan Parliament, who in 2010 [passed a law forbidding a lot of shows with animal suffering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_on_bullfighting_in_Catalonia), bullfighting among them. Then spanish people brought another PLI to the Spanish Parliament requesting protection for bullfighting, which [was approved in 2013](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/bullfighting-declared-part-of-spains-cultural-heritage-8492267.html), forbidding the Catalan prohibition. As if that wasn't enough, in 2016 [the Constitutional Court overturned the Catalan law forbidding bullfighting](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/20/spanish-court-overturns-catalonia-bullfighting-ban). If Catalan laws are repealed or overturned systematically, if bullfighting is forced in Catalonia, then Catalan people see independence as the only way out to get something done. ![An excerpt of repealed laws in Catalonia since 2012](/assets/images/repealed-laws.jpg "Repealed laws in Catalonia since 2012"){:.some-css-class width="300"}

- Another reason is the repeal of the new Catalan Autonomy Statute. In 2005, the Catalan Government approved a renewed Autonomy Statute with the support of 89% of the seats. One of the most important subjects in the new Statute was defining Catalonia as a "nation" (which it is, [according to the Spanish dictionary](http://dle.rae.es/?id=QBmDD68). This law was approved in 2006 the Spanish Parliament too (after substantial modifications), by the 54% of the seats. Finally, it was voted on a referendum and it got 75% of approval. All the legal procedures were followed to the letter, but that wasn't enough: in 2010 the Constitutional Court repealed a good amount of its articles. The resulting Autonomy Statute was not the one the catalans voted, therefore it wasn't approved by the Catalans, as the Constitution says it should be. For many catalans, in that moment it became clear that Spain has no interest in finding a fit for Catalonia, and any the Spanish law was a dead end. It became clear that, in order to change things, sticking to the law wouldn't play on Catalonia's favour.

- There are also some people complaining about overtaxation. While Catalonia's population is around 15% of Spanish population, and Catalonia's territory is 6% of Spain's territory, Catalonia holds 20% of Spanish GDP. Infrastructures have been deteriorating, the commuter rail has a really bad record. Catalan people are not against solidarity (for instance, [the yearly Catalan TV Charity Fundraiser](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Marat%C3%B3_de_TV3) raises more money than all Spanish TVs Charity Fundraisers combined), but they think with proper funding the Catalan economy could grow, collect more taxes to pay for better services for all, not only for them.

- [Political corruption is endemic in Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_Spain), with [very outraging cases](https://www.thelocal.es/20160128/nine-spanish-corruption-scandals-that-will-take-your-breath-away). The worst part is the political parties behind the crimes keep getting votes from the citizens, so they continue in power, and they continue embezzling. An example of [corruption in Madrid](http://www.casos-aislados.com/Caso-por-comunidad.php?Comunidad=Comunidad%20de%20Madrid) is Ignacio González, former President of Madrid, who is charged not only of embezzelment, but also for covering up for Ruiz Gallardón (the previous president) embezzelments. The Popular Party has been using [illegal funding for the last 25 years])http://www.eldiario.es/escolar/contabilidad-PP-Barcenas_6_384321604.html), [almost all of their accountants were charged with crimes](http://www.servimedia.es/Noticias/Detalle.aspx?n=521261&s=1), [the party destroyed evidence](http://www.eldiario.es/politica/procesa-Partido-Popular-ordenadores-Barcenas_0_541396291.html), [their headquarters were paid with dirty money](https://elpais.com/elpais/2014/06/05/media/1401994595_739254.html), [Francisco Granados](http://www.publico.es/politica/francisco-granados-e-ignacio-gonzalez-numeros-tres-esperanza-aguirre-comparecen-distintas-tramas-corrupcion-audiencia-nacional.html) was in TV debates condemning corruption while he was embezzling at that very moment... And the list goes on.

There was also corruption in the Catalan Government. It was under Pujol's rule, until 2003. After it was discovered, [Pujol was disowned of all his titles](http://www.antena3.com/noticias/espana/retirada-titulos-distinciones-jordi-pujol_20140731571f69196584a8abb58412ac.html), he is court, and his party suffered a harsh scold in the following elections, they had to [split](http://www.elmundo.es/cataluna/2015/06/18/55829b7a22601d1a5c8b457f.html) and start with [different names and different people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_European_Democratic_Party).

Catalan people can't understand why corruption is not punished in the ballot boxes.

### I heard the Kingdom of Spain is one of the most decentralized countries in the world... What are catalans complaining about?

The theory may say so, but the Spanish government has been actively challenging all social laws approved in the Catalan government. A few examples are:

- May 2014: the Constitutional Court rules that Catalonia’s one euro tax on every medical prescription, together with the Generalitat’s judicial tax, are unconstitutional.
- October 2014: the Court hears Madrid’s challenge against the reform of Catalonia’s consumers’ Code.
- November 2014: a law that banned fracking in Catalonia and other Spanish regions is suspended.
- November 2014: the Constitutional court hears Madrid’s appeal against the law of fiscal and administrative measures, and Catalonia’s public sector.
- December 2014: the Constitutional court hears Madrid’s appeal against the Catalan law that regulates business hours for the retail industry.
- January 2015: the Constitutional court hears Madrid’s appeal against Catalonia’s law that imposed a tax on bank accounts.
- March 2015: the Constitutional court hears an appeal filed by Spain’s Ombudsman and rules that several articles of Catalonia’s Ombudsman law are null and void.
- April 2015: the Constitutional Court hears an appeal by the Spanish government against Catalonia’s foreign policy law.
- June 2015: two Catalan rules on taxes levied on bank account holders are found to be unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court.
- June 2015: challenge and suspension of Catalonia’s 2015 budget.
- June 2015: challenge and suspension of a number of provisions in Catalonia’s law on fiscal, financial and administrative measures.
- July 2015: challenge and suspension of Catalonia’s law that taxed industrial and commercial airplane emissions and nuclear-generated electricity.
- September 2015: challenge and suspension of Catalonia’s law that regulated a new tax on providers of electronic communications. This was a tax on telecom operators -the broadband tax- and the revenue levied was meant to support Catalonia’s media industry.
- September 2015: challenge and suspension of the law that sought to reform Catalonia’s Treasury Office.
- October 2015: challenge and suspension of Catalonia’s consumers’ code. It established a number of measures against energy poverty and abusive clauses in mortgage contracts and other financial products.
- October 2015: challenge and suspension of Catalonia’s law on retail outlets which effectively banned new retail space in the outskirts of towns and cities.

There is a [Deeper data analysis about decentralization](http://www.unc.edu/~gwmarks/data_ra.php), taking into account policies/powers/fiscal and not only fiscal (which it's not the only matter when analysing decentralization).

### I heard they don't teach Spanish in catalan schools. Is that true?

Spanish classes are mandatory thoughout all the stages in the school, and all students must know spanish and catalan to advance. And they do, as studies show catalans speak spanish above the spanish average, as we can see in the next graph, with official data from the Spanish government:

### Is the elected President Puigdemont a fugitive?

He is not, he is collaborating with the courts. On October 30th, when there were no charges against him, he traveled legally to Belgium as a free EU citizen. Two days later, when the Spanish judge pressed charges and shortly afterwards sent an European arrest warrant, elected President Puigdemont (along with other 4 cabinet members) turned himself in to the judicial police in Brussels. He had a court hearing and was released with precautionary measures (he can't leave Belgium). The court now must decide within 15 days if the arrest order is executed, but then both parts can appeal so it will probably take months before we have a final verdict.

### Why is the elected President Puigdemont in Belgium?

He claims he wouldn't get a fair trial in Spain because there are no separation of powers. The Spanish judge proved him right when half the elected cabinet was imprisoned after the first hearing as precautionary measures in a process full of irregularities, while he still walks free.

### What kind of irregularities can we find in the Catalan elected cabinet trials?

- The members of the elected cabinet are charged with "rebellion". That law explicitely says there must be violence in order to consider a "rebellion". There has been no violence in any of the pro-independence rallies or events, and the judge stated that "rallies are intimidating, and that's a form of violence". The judge also related the nightly "cassolada" (the protest where people hit for a short time pots and pans inside their homes to make noise) with the violence. This "violence" claim is so disputed that even the lawyer editor of the rebellion law (a unionist person) said publicly this is not a rebellion case

```Diego López Garrido, who drafted changes to the Spanish legal code relating to rebellion, told Antena 3 that “in my judgment, there is no crime of rebellion because no violence has been produced.”``` [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/world/europe/Carlos-puigdemont-Belgium-Spain.html)

- The case has been taken by the "Audiencia Nacional" court, instead of the "Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Catalunya", where it should be tried. In 2008, the "Audiencia Nacional" court unanimously stated they had no competence in rebellion crimes. [Original Document, page 4](http://www.poderjudicial.es/search/contenidos.action?action=contentpdf&databasematch=AN&reference=4273730&links=&optimize=20090205&publicinterface=true). This violates [the principle of natural judge](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwig4oGnxb_XAhVKmBoKHa1_CB0QFggmMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FNatural_justice&usg=AOvVaw3vpYdA4nhrWiV5Ur7-mAGC), vital to fair trials.

- The defendants received the subpoena on a holiday, summoning them for a hearing 24h later. There was no time to find a lawyer who can read the charges and properly build their cases for such a complex accusation, violating the right to fair trial.

- The public prosecutor [Maza has been comdemned by the Spanish Parliament](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjlqYO4y7_XAhUBuhoKHUp6CaIQFggmMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.publico.es%2Fpolitica%2Fcongreso-reprueba-catala-fiscales-maza.html&usg=AOvVaw0J7psm06jNnI9YMTcVgpDO) for protecting the Spanish government in their corruption trials instead of doing his job.

### Will the elected President Puigdemont run for office again in Dec 21st elections?

Although there are some charges against him, there is no sentence, therefore he is innocent (until proven guilty). As a free citizen, he has the right to run for office, and he'll be leading "Junts per Catalunya" (Together for Catalonia) 

## Catalan Referendum

### Was there police brutality?

There was, a lot. Although some people claim "fake news", there are abundant evidence of the facts. There are more than 150 videos in [https://spanishpolice.github.io/](https://spanishpolice.github.io/), all of them verified.

There were also a few false videos and pictures of unknown sources. But even though they existed, they were quickly discredited and ignored, and those are not among the videos in  [https://spanishpolice.github.io/](https://spanishpolice.github.io/)

### I heard there were fake videos and pictures

There were also a few false videos and pictures of unknown sources, quickly discredited and ignored. We can confirm the videos in [https://spanishpolice.github.io/](https://spanishpolice.github.io/), are verified, all of them.

## Legality

### Is self-determination actually a right in Catalonia?

It is quite a convoluted subject. Spanish Constitution states clearly the "indissoluble unity of the Spanish Nation", but Spain also joined the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/), and its article 15 states clearly [the right of people to self-determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination), hence the legal conflict between domestic and international law.

The Human Rights should be hierarchically above the Spanish Constitution, as it states the very basic human rights we can't live without. If a domestic constitution removes freedom of speech, that country is not enforcing Human Rights anymore.

In Spain there is no debate: the Constitution is above everything else, even above the Declaration of Human Rights. But in the international scene there are different opinions. For instance, [Alfred de Zayas](https://dezayasalfred.wordpress.com/2017/09/23/media-statement-violation-of-the-right-of-self-determination-of-the-catalan-people/), a ["UN Independent Expert on the Promotion of a Democratic and Equitable International Order"](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/IntOrder/Pages/IEInternationalorderIndex.aspx) says "cease interfering with the exercise of fundamental democratic rights, including the rights of freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and association, and the non-derogable right of the self-determination of all peoples.", or [Craig Murray](https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2017/10/obliged-reconsider-support-european-union/), former british ambassador, says "The rights conferred by the UN Charter are inalienable. A people can never give up its right of self-determination.".

### Are there political prisoners in Spain?

This is a highly controversial issue. But before getting into details, we must keep in mind no government has ever acknowledged imprisoning people for their ideals, or having "political prisoners". All governments always say the imprisoned people deserve deserve to be because they broke one law or another, so we wouldn't expect a different answer from the Spanish government. Gandhi was "bringing or attempting to excite disaffection towards His Majesty's Government established by law in British India", Mandela was accused of "sabotage and conspiracy to violently overthrow the government", and so on.

In the Kingdom of Spain there are two different cases:
- Civil leaders Jordi Sanchez and Jordi Cuixart ("The Jordis") are accused of sedition, because they called for a rally in front of a building where the police were raiding official catalan headquarters. There were 3 police cars vandalized.
- The elected Catalan Government is accused of rebellion (for passing laws allowing the independence), sedition (in case the rebellion charge doesn't take) and embezzlement (for spending money to fund the referendum)

All of them were questioned about their ideals before being sent to prison, and asked to renounce them. None of them had a fair trial, they were imprisoned as a precautionary measures so they wouldn't destroy evidence (although the judge has not tried to get new evidence since then).

### Can I know the details about the charges against "The Jordis"?

Civil leaders Jordi Cuixart and Jordi Sanchez are in charge of two civil movements that have been promoting independence, ANC and Omnium Cultural. After 2010, their rallies gathered more than 1,000,000 people on the Catalan National Day. Those rallies were distinguished by the amount of demonstrators (usually over a million people), the festive environment, the peacefulness, creativity and the lack of incidents. Organizations all over the world praised such a model rallies.

On 20th September, just 10 days before the Catalan Referendum was about to be held, and when the police was desperately looking for evidence to stop it (unsuccessfully), police officers raided some government buildings and arrested 11 public servants. People spontaneously gathered in front of those buildings protesting the arrests, and around 40,000 people gathered around the Catalan Treasure Department. None of those 40.000 people tried to get inside the building or interfere with police raids, which took hours, and the people outside spent the day chanting. When the police was done and wanted to leave, the organizers opened a corridor so they could leave without problems. There is video evidence of the Jordis convincing people to let the police do their job, and calling to dismiss the rally after midnight. The policemen could leave carrying everything they raided with them without problem through the corridor prepared by the organizers. But they couldn't go back with their cars, because they had been vandalized.

The policemen left their patrol cars, open and with guns inside, in front of the building. When the big crowd was around it, the cars were vandalized, filled with stickers, punctured tyres and some broken glasses. Nobody in the crowd touched the guns, although they were there, a hazard for everybody. Eventually, after the crowd dissolved, the cars were towed away because they couldn't travel otherwise.

For this events, even when there is evidence of them doing the opposite as the charges say, the Jordis were charged with sedition, a legal term loosely defined in the spanish law as leading a crowd in order to prevent the authorities carry on their legitimate duties. It is a crime from the medieval ages, and there is almost no jurisdiction for this crime, so we're in uncharted territories.

They were imprisoned without a trial as precautionary measures because the judge considered they could keep commiting the same crime (call and attend to rallies) and they could destroy evidence. But nobody went to gather any more evidence, so the second part shouldn't apply. And the first part means they shouldn't be allowed to rally anymore.


## About Catalans

### I heard catalans are unsopportive of the other people. Is that true?

Catalonia has always been a welcoming place where people from all places have found their home. An integrating society where no matter where you're from, you'll be treated as equal. To illustrate this, let see how [thousands of catalans rallied demanding to take more refugees in](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/18/protesters-in-barcelona-urge-spain-to-take-in-more-refugees)
